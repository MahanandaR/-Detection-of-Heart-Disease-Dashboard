❤️ Heart Disease Prediction Dashboard (Power BI)
Project Overview
----------------------------------------------------
The Heart Disease Prediction Dashboard is built using Power BI to analyze patient health data and provide insights into factors contributing to heart disease.
It allows healthcare professionals, analysts, and researchers to explore trends, compare patient groups, and identify patterns that may indicate a higher risk of heart disease.

Key Features

📊 Interactive Filters – Filter results by Gender, Age Group, Chest Pain, ECG, and Stress Test.

📈 Dynamic Visuals – Multiple charts including bar, line, and pie charts to show relationships between health factors.

KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) –
---------------------------------------
Average Cholesterol

Average Blood Pressure

Average Thalassemia

Number of Positive Heart Patients

Insightful Analysis – Helps in understanding the correlation between age, cholesterol, thalassemia, blood pressure, and heart disease.

Dashboard Components
--------------------------
Thalassemia vs Target – Shows the relation of thalassemia with heart disease presence.

Target vs Age Group – Distribution of heart disease patients by age (Young, Middle, Old).

Blood Pressure & Cholesterol vs Fasting Blood Sugar – Compares key vitals across sugar levels.

Chest Pain vs Gender – Analysis of chest pain types across male and female patients.

Resting ECG vs Oldpeak – Shows average oldpeak values by ECG types with/without heart disease.

Age Group vs Average Vitals – Compares blood pressure, cholesterol, and thalassemia across age groups.

Dataset
------------------
The dashboard uses a Heart Disease dataset containing patient medical records with attributes such as:

Age, Gender

Cholesterol, Blood Pressure

Chest Pain Type

Resting ECG Results

Stress Test Results

Thalassemia, Oldpeak

Target (Presence/Absence of Heart Disease)

 Dataset Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository - Heart Disease Dataset
 or Kaggle Heart Disease Dataset

How to Use
-----------------------
Download the repository.

Open the Power BI file (Heart_Disease_Dashboard.pbix).

Use the slicers (filters) to interact with the dashboard and analyze the data.

Future Improvements
---------------------------------------
Adding predictive insights using machine learning integration.

Real-time connection with healthcare databases.

Advanced drill-down analysis for each patient record.
